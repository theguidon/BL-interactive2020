Arroyo’s husband, Jose Miguel Arroyo, had also filed many libel cases against journalists, which was part of an anti-press initiative, according to Center for Media Freedom and Responsibility (CMFR) Deputy Director Luis Teodoro. The Arroyo administration also saw the highest number of journalist deaths in a single day as a result of the infamous Ampatuan massacre, more commonly known as the “Maguindanao massacre.” The CMFR <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/193882-threats-attacks-philippines-media-timeline">reports</a> that there were 83 journalist murders during Arroyo’s nine-year presidency, but only 80 have been named based on data from the Committee to Protect Journalists.`,

He alleged that this was due to Ortega’s staunch opposition on local corruption and reporting on mining operations in Palawan. A Department of Justice panel dismissed the charges against the Reyes brothers.However, in 2013, a second panel reserved the decision due to new evidence but was blocked by an appellate court.After the appellate court’s decision, the Reyes brothers went into hiding.On March 2016, a former aide to Joel Reyes, Arturo Regalado, was found guilty of being involved in Ortega’s murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison.In January 2018, Joel Reyes was arrested for graft charges in relation to a mining company that was allowed to over- extract ore in Palawan.",

The day before Lozada’s death, the Office of the Ombudsman ordered Navarro and 11 others to be dismissed from service due to the anomalous purchase. According to his sister, Lozada also received anonymous death threats prior to his murder. Lozada was driving home when gunmen aboard a van shot him, killing him and wounding his wife.
